I try to stay at some intermediate level in the computer area - the core I believe is to select a few or maybe just one theme, computers is like going into a library, you might know some of the base topics in the shelves, but no chance in ever to know it all. Some may tell you that keep it simple at the front end, and as in math you can get a long way with the base elements of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division - or maybe only addition when you include the integers on both sides of origo. :-)

# hello-world
thank you - I am new in this area, and curious on Github and Powershell, the Just Enought Administration and Just In Time concepts.
